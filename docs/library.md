# Library (Skills and MCP servers)

The library is a place inside the AgEnD data folder to keep **skills** and **MCP server definitions**. It is storage and a viewer only:
nothing in it is given to an agent yet, so no agent's files, settings or instructions change whether the library is empty or full.
(Giving a library skill to an agent, and sharing library items inside an exported agent file, are separate later steps. The agent
export file already reserves an empty `library:` section for them.)

Open it from the sidebar (**Library**, `/ui/library`). It is for an administrator; a fleet that never opens it gets no `library/` folder.

## Where it lives

```
<AGEND_HOME>/library/
  skills/<id>/SKILL.md          # + optional supporting files (references/, scripts/, …)
  mcp/<id>.yaml
  library.lock.json             # sha256, size and source of every item added through AgEnD
```

`<id>` is lowercase letters, digits and dashes (up to 64), the same rule as the bundled skills.

## Skills

The usual Claude Code / Multica layout: a folder with a `SKILL.md` that starts with a `---` block holding `name` (must equal `<id>`) and
`description`, then the instructions. Supporting files must be text. Limits: `SKILL.md` 100 KiB, other files 200 KiB each, 384 KiB and 64
files in all; file paths are relative, `/`-separated, at most 6 deep, made of letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, none hidden, none leaving
the folder.

## MCP servers

One YAML file that names the **variables** a server needs — never their values:

```yaml
agend_library: 1
kind: mcp
name: github
description: GitHub issues and pull requests
transport: stdio            # or http
command: npx
args: [-y, "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
env: [GITHUB_TOKEN]         # names only; a `KEY: value` map is refused
```

An `http` server has `url` (no credentials, no query string) and `headers`, a map from header name to the variable holding its value
(`Authorization: GITHUB_TOKEN`).

## Secrets

Anything that looks like a key, token or password (the same scan the agent export uses) is refused with the file and line, never the value.

## Safety

Every read treats the folder as untrusted: symlinks are never followed (an item that is or contains one is listed as *Not usable*),
sizes are capped, and only valid ids are listed. Writes validate first and land atomically. The lock lets a later step tell an item
changed by hand (*Changed by hand*), one added outside this page (*Not recorded*) and one whose files are gone (*Missing*).

## Web routes (admin only)

`GET /ui/library/list`, `GET /ui/library/item?kind=skill|mcp&id=<id>`, `POST /ui/library/save`, `POST /ui/library/delete`.
